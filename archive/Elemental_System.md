# Elemental Attunement System

Each run begins as a Neutral Wizard with weak orbiting orbs. At the first level-up, the player chooses 1 of 3 randomly offered elements. This permanently transforms the Wizard into an Elemental Archetype for the remainder of the run.

Each Element grants:
- **1 Core Passive** (applied immediately upon attunement)
- **3 Common Upgrades** (appear during level-ups throughout the run)

No rare upgrades or capstones are included in this tech demo version.
